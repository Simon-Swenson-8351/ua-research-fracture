This projected began as my (Simon's) final for data visualization. It's a map 
view similar to Google Maps that also incorporates local change data. To run it, 
you'll need some libraries (wxPython) and a data set. An example data set can be 
found at bayes01:/data/fracture/roadside-change-visualization-data. Simply 
extract that to the source code's directory, then run SSTerrainDiffVis.py using 
Python.
