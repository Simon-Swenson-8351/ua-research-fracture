Various utilities. Some are for converting files and moving data around, some do 
some calculations on multiple modes of data. I have tried to 
name them to be self expanatory, but most of them don't have good documentation, 
so you'll have to dig into the code a bit to figure out how to use them. The 
up-side is that most of them are fairly short.
